# FlatScraper
This is far from anything "professional" or "good". The only reason this project exists is because I had a usecase for it. The only reason why It's public is because I want to allow who ever finds any of this useful to copy it from here.

## What does it do
Tiny python script to collect available flats within hardcoded arial codes and a hardcoded price range and notify what ever telegram bot is configured. The tool scrapps Homegate and Comparis as those two are the most relevant ones in Switzerland.

## Why?
Because it made my life easier

## Who can use it?
Everyone is free to clone the repo and do changes to fit given usecases.

## How do I run it?
Just enter a valid bot token in the code and install all needed dependencies.

## Where do I get a token from?
https://core.telegram.org/bots
